Each file contains groups corresponding to the different elements
(e.g., "/Carbon"). Hydrogen and helium are considered simultaneously
in the group "/Metal_free". 

All metals (not just the ones we do separately) are considered
simultaneously in the group "/Total_Metals". This latter table is useful if
the metallicity is known, but not the abundances of individual
elements.  The metal and H&He contributions to the cooling rates can
be combined and scaled to the desired metallicity as described in
WSS08 (eq. 4).

The group "/Header" contains some useful meta-data and the group
"/Solar" considers all elements simultaneously (assuming solar
abundances).
 

The ranges of the tables are as follows:
Temperature: 100 K - 9.5907002E8 K
Hydrogen density: 1 cm^-3 - 1e-8 cm^-3
Redshift: 0 - 8.989
Helium mass fraction (Helium number ratio): 0.238 - 0.338 (0.07865282 - 
0.128)
Energy density: 1e10 erg/g - 1e18 erg/g
